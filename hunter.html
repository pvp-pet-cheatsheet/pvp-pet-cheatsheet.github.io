 4pc bonus
  The 4 piece bonus takes a while to stack up the % damage, making it unreliable for certain situations. It also ONLY increases fire damage which in the long run, pure gear scaling damage will be higher. On top of that, black arrow is dispellable and even though the CD gets reset if it gets dispelled, it's has a heavy focus cost. The 4 piece debuff itself is also dispellable.
 
 best hunter pet
   There is no best pet. You either play a Grievous Wounds pet (25% reduced healing) or a pet that gives a buff that your arena partners do not offer.
   
   trap launcher
   There's no travel time when trap launcher is turned off, it's harder to avoid trap launcher, and latency/lag comes into play if you try to launch traps. Also, kneeling traps down is a lot more discreet and I don't have to focus on landing my trap as much when I kneel it down.
   
   
   ammo
    If my partner doesn't have a constant slow and if I'm fighting a class that constantly avoids slows (Rogues/Druids/Hunters) or a double melee cleave, I play frozen ammo. Otherwise, I play poisoned ammo and maximize damage.
    
    wyvern /binding
     As thug cleave, I ALWAYS play wyvern sting. Other than that, I switch between that comp I'm playing or fighting. Usually, I'll use wyvern if I fight a warlock or a shadow priest because they can dispel traps.
